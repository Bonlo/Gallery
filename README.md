# Gallery

My first project, not maintenained at this time
=======
# PHP Gallery for MVC usage

- DB connection with PDO (you can easily configure the very beginning of App.php),
- Sign in/sign up
- Upload photos to the database, they will be automatically visible through Photo::read(),
- Search Photos by tag, name, author or exifs (exifs are collectable but not available for the moment).
